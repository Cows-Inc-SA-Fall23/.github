The project undertaken by Group 11 is focused on developing a software architecture for an Industry 4.0 production domain. The intent of the project is to create a system that can handle various aspects of production, including monitoring biometrics, managing feed, and handling orders. The project involves setting up a GitHub repository, identifying systems and subsystems, and choosing appropriate programming languages and databases. The project aims to enhance the interoperability of the system, handle big data, and ensure continuous operation of key components.
